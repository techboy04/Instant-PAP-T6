# Instant Pack A Punch
Tired of your weapon being taken away by the pack a punch machine?
or tired of your weapon taking too long to pack a punch?
or you lacking the timeframe to be able to grab it in the heat of the moment?

Introducing Instant Pack A Punch! This changes the pack a punch (while also adding the config ability to change its price) so the upgrade is instantanious instead of having to wait for it to appear out of the machine

## Installation
Download instantpackapunch.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using instantpackapunch_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice

## Configuration
This mod contains a few configurable options!

```set value num```

``pap_price`` - Set the price for what you want the fast travel to be - Default: 5000
